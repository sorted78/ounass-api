FIXED: Feature Mismatch Issue
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The issue was that the model created different features during training vs prediction.
This has been fixed!

Now follow these steps:

STEP 1: Restart the API
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Press CTRL+C to stop the current API, then run:

  ./run.sh


STEP 2: Retrain the Model with Fixed Code
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/train

You should see:
{
  "frontend_mae": 0.xx,
  "frontend_rmse": 0.xx,
  "frontend_r2": 0.xx,
  ...
}


STEP 3: Test Predictions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Get a single day prediction:
  curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/forecast/daily?target_date=2024-06-01"

Get a 7-day range:
  curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/forecast/range?start_date=2024-06-01&days=7"


WHAT WAS FIXED?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The model now:
✅ Stores exactly which features it used during training
✅ Uses those exact same features during prediction
✅ No longer tries to create rolling averages during single-row predictions
✅ Consistent feature set = no more "expecting 12 features" errors
